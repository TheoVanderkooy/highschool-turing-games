# highschool-turing-games
Some games I made in Turing during highschool (grade 10, 2013-2014)

Get turing [here](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/) to run these.


- 2048.t: My own version of the 2048 mobile game (my version never randomly generates 4s, this is intentional).
- Hexagon.t: My version of [Super Hexagon](https://www.superhexagon.com/) (also on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221640/Super_Hexagon/)).
- gridlocked: Final project, basically Tron. Has music not included in repo, can be downloaded from [incompetech](https://incompetech.com/). The song is "The Complex" and the file must be called "The Complex.mp3". The music can also be disbled in the settings.
